## 2. Installation
Let us start the install process.

### [Prepare your PC for Wabbajack](https://github.com/Kvitekvist/Auriel-s-Dream/wiki/Prepare-PC-for-modlist) (Do this if you do not already have Wabbajack setup)
See this page, if it is your first time installing a Wabbajack list.
It will take you through a process that makes sure WJ can install correctly, that windows will not block any files and how to prevent automatic steam updates for SkyrimVR. All these together makes sure that the install process is the same and goes smoothly for all users.

## 3. Optional steps to do after Auriel's Dream is installed
The game is now ready to launch. But you can make a few optional selections before booting.

### 3.1 Activate the Essential Files and ENB
This step is optional. 
Here we have 3 categories. Opencomposite, ENB / ReShade and Upscaler.

**Opencomposite** is recommended for meta quest users. But it only works with link cable or air link, not virtual desktop. This option gives you a huge performance boost.

**ENB or ReShade** is a visual improvement, but it cost FPS. How much is indicated with low, medium or high.  High cost dont always mean better visuals. Try them out. Only choose one ENB or one ReShade. You can also use one ENB and one ReShade together but i wont recommend that for most users.

**Upscaler** is also kind of recommended. Choose one.
DLAA cost more FPS but also removes pretty much all shimmer in the game. Need RTX graphics card.
DLSS gives performance boost but lowers the visual quality a little. Also removes shimmer. Need RTX graphics card.
FSR works for both AMD and  Nvidia cards. Applies foveated rendering, boosting performance by reducing resolution of stuff that is not in the center of the lenses.

**DO NOT RUN LOOT!** Everytime you run LOOT a kitten dies and we cry in the corner. The load order is exactly as it should be, do not change it

## 4. How to start up Auriel's Dream

Head over to the installation folder and locate an executable named `ModOrganizer.exe` and launch it. Once its launched there will be a dropdown box on the top right and a big run button next to it. Ensure it is set to "Play" by selecting it in the dropdown box and then hitting the run button.

### Setup VRIK
I made 2 videos for VRIK
1. Setup Weapon Holsters: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTGhQCVcgNE
In this video you learn how you can attach weapons to your avator body in VR. Meaning you can grab a a bow from your back, a sword from your hip and so on.
2. Setup Gestures: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEi7gwN8hgg
Gestures are VERY powerful in VR. By making hand gestures you can instantly equip a spell, weapon or even armor. You can instantly cast spells by waving your hand, or consume potions. Playing this way allows you to avoid opening the menu too frequently.
